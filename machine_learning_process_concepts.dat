1. feature engineering
   autoencoder
   data transform (to normal distribution(log, box-cox), scale, shift...)
   fill missing data
   data outliers
   feature correlation with each other and with independent variable
   generate new feature
   choose relevent feature
   data augmentation

2. Model grid search for best hyperparameters

3. Build model
   (1) k fold cross-validation
   (2) Linear model:
       logistic regression
       linear, ridge, kernel ridge, lasso, elastic net regression
       Tree based model:
       decision tree, random forest, adaboost, gradient boost(XGBoost, Lightgbm) 
       Support vector machine
       Factorization machine
       Neural network
       Bayers model
       Linear (Quadratic) discriminate analysis
       PCA
       KNN
       K-means clustering
    (3) if target variable is unevenly distributed, use f1 score instead of accuracy(can use confusion matrix, roc curve)

4. How to deal with unbalanced data?
   oversampling and undersampling
